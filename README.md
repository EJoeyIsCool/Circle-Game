# Circle-Game
This program was coded in PyGame. Use your mouse to avoid the circles hunting you down!

Make sure to have PyGame installed before playing, otherwise the program will fail to run. Also, make sure to run the program such that the heart asset is in the same folder as the game file so that it displays properly.
